## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("config.yaml", "Contains the configuration for the chatbot, such as the API key and model."),
    ("main.py", "The entry point of the application. It creates the Flask app and the ChatApp instance."),
    ("chatbot.py", "Contains the ChatBot class which communicates with the OpenAI API."),
    ("utils.py", "Contains utility functions used throughout the application."),
    ("exceptions.py", "Contains custom exceptions used in the application."),
    ("templates/index.html", "The HTML template for the chat interface."),
    ("static/css/styles.css", "The CSS styles for the chat interface."),
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "config.yaml",
    "exceptions.py",
    "utils.py",
    "chatbot.py",
    "main.py",
    "templates/index.html",
    "static/css/styles.css",
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'config.yaml' contains the API key and model for the OpenAI API. These should be kept secret and not committed to version control.

'utils.py' contains utility functions that are used throughout the application. These functions should be stateless and not depend on any global variables.

'main.py' is the entry point of the application. It creates the Flask app and the ChatApp instance, and starts the Flask server.

'chatbot.py' contains the ChatBot class which communicates with the OpenAI API. It uses the API key and model from 'config.yaml'.

'exceptions.py' contains custom exceptions used in the application. These exceptions should be used to handle errors in a consistent way.

'templates/index.html' and 'static/css/styles.css' contain the HTML and CSS for the chat interface. These files should be kept separate from the Python code.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. The main entry point of the application is 'main.py'. The Flask server should be started with the command 'python main.py'. The OpenAI API key and model should be specified in 'config.yaml'.
